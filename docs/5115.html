All these things matter a lot.<br/>Number two, poor people get paid based on time,<br/>rich people get paid based on results.<br/>Let’s say you’re working at McDonalds,<br/>you may be the best floor cleaner on the planet ever,<br/>but what value do you bring to McDonald?<br/>Rich people, we get paid based on results,<br/>not time invested.<br/>Let’s say we’re working on a product,<br/>we spent a year creating, perfecting the product,<br/>we bring it to the marketplace, and it sucks,<br/>it bombs, it doesn’t make us a dime.<br/>The world doesn’t give a fuck.<br/>We don’t make money.<br/>Nobody cares how much time, blood, sweat,<br/>and tears were put into creating a product<br/>and bring it to the marketplace.<br/>How much risk that we take, they don’t care.<br/>What they care is results.<br/>That’s why the highest paid athletes in the world,<br/>they don’t get paid by how many hours they practice,<br/>how many times they invested,<br/>no, it is how much they perform.<br/>They get paid based on performance.<br/>Number three, poor people, they blame others<br/>for their misfortunes.<br/>Rich people, we take responsibility for our own failures.<br/>You see, for poor people it’s always somebody else’s fault.<br/>It’s the economy, it’s the government, it’s my boss,<br/>it’s my job, it’s my city,<br/>it’s my neighbor, it’s my friends.<br/>It’s always somebody else.<br/>It’s never their own fucking fault.<br/>Rich people, we take responsibility.<br/>If your life stinks it’s your fault.<br/>We take responsibility for own action.<br/>When you take responsibility,<br/>what happens is you gain power.<br/>The power to change.<br/>The power to do something different.<br/>Remember, lame people blame people.<br/>Number four, poor people focus on saving,<br/>and rich people focus in investing.<br/>You know what?<br/>Don’t drink that Starbucks coffee in the morning,<br/>try to save a few dollars in here and there.<br/>Don’t fly first class, fly economy.<br/>Always try to save a few dollars.<br/>Well, here’s the thing, a penny saved<br/>is still a penny.<br/>You’re not gonna get rich by trying to save a few bucks.<br/>You don’t have a saving problem, you have an income problem.<br/>You need to earn a lot more money, so you could invest.<br/>Number five, poor people, they know it all.<br/>Rich people continuously to learn.<br/>You see, poor people are always very opinionated.<br/>They always want to tell the world about their opinions,<br/>about politics, about sports, about the society,<br/>about the government, about every single thing<br/>that’s around them.<br/>Versus being humble, willing to learn.<br/>Rich people, we’re always learning.<br/>We’re asking questions, we are listening,<br/>we are reading books, continuous learning.<br/>Versus, saying that I’ve got an opinion<br/>about fucking everything.<br/>You know why they always have an opinion, poor people?<br/>Because the only way to get little bit of fucking attention.<br/><br/>Remember, your income can only grow<br/>to the extent that you do.<br/>Your wealth can only grow as fast as you do.<br/>Number six, poor people believe that money<br/>is the root of all evil.<br/>Rich people, we believe that poverty<br/>is the root of all evil.<br/>You’ve heard of the saying, “Money is the root of all evil.”<br/>No, lack of money is the root of all evil.<br/>I want you to look at the poorest neighborhoods.<br/>I want you to think about those areas.<br/>Crime, drug, problems, all kinds of issues.<br/>You see, in the history of mankind,<br/>no banks been robbed by someone pulling up in a Rolls-Royce.<br/>It is the survival, it’s the lack of money,<br/>that’s causing the issue.<br/>Money itself is neutral.<br/>Money is like a tool, you can use it for good,<br/>or you can use it for evil.<br/>It is all up to you.<br/>Number seven, poor people they have lottery mentality,<br/>and rich people, we have action mentality.<br/>You see, most people, they believe the only way<br/>to get rich is buying that lottery ticket.<br/>Even though they know that the chance of winning<br/>is slim to none, but they buy that fantasy.<br/>Hopefully, if I win I’m gonna buy that house,<br/>I’m gonna quit that job, I’m gonna take that vacation.<br/>No, rich people have an action mentality.<br/>We believe if it’s going to be it is up to me.<br/>I’m gonna make it happen.<br/>I’m gonna make myself successful.<br/>I don’t need to rely on some third party,<br/>and I definitely don’t need to rely on some lottery ticket.<br/>I’m gonna make it happen.<br/>So those are the seven things that poor people do<br/>that the rich don’t.</p></div></div>
