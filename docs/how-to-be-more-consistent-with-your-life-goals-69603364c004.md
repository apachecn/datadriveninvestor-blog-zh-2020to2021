Consistency is the key to success. You have to be fully dedicated to each task that you do to achieve your goals and succeed. It requires a commitment to be done on your part by developing habits that you need to do on a daily basis.

Having said that, some people may find it difficult to stay consistent and are likely to struggle with the idea to do so. The number one reason was that some people want immediate and quick results from their actions in everything that they do, however, being consistent isn’t something that one should do on a short term basis as building habits isn’t something that can be developed overnight, it’s a matter of progress and improvements through step by step process that can evolve throughout months and can even lead to many years. You constantly developed and advance your skills because of the amount of consistency you are putting towards it through practice and repetitions.

> The more you are putting consistent efforts into each task or skill that you do, the more you are likely to achieve your goals and succeed in it.

Nonetheless, to be more consistent with your goals you don’t need to force yourself to take action especially if you are lacking the motivation and willpower to do so. Because to be more consistent, you have to love what you do first, as taking action and becoming consistent with it will come naturally once you did.

Continue being passionate and motivated towards your goals, that nothing can stop you from achieving it, because no matter how many steps it takes for you to reach your goals, once you are passionate and motivated to continue doing so, you will always be willing to stay consistent with your habits just to reach your desired outcome.

With that said, if you want to stay consistent you have to change the unhealthy habits that you do and start to devote and give time to develop new habits that can help you reach your goals. It doesn’t matter how big or small that is, as long as you keep on doing it regularly and adapt it to your lifestyle.

**1\. Plan each task** — Consistency requires you to plan all the tasks that you need to be doing in order for you to reach your goals. Without planning, you will be all over the place unable to finish the most important thing you need to be done as you are occupied with all the other activities as well.

It can make you become disorganized which decreases your productivity and make it less effective.

通过仔细的计划，它给你一次专注于一件事的能力，并且明确你的目标。你可以用日历记下你每天需要完成的每项任务的开始日期和你期望的完成日期。这样，你也给了时间去做其他你需要做的事情，而不是仅仅被一件事情所困扰。这不仅有助于你变得更有效率和更有成果，也有助于你在日常工作中变得更加稳定。

**2。列出每一步**——写下你完成目标所需的每一步，列出你需要优先考虑的事情，以及你需要实施的其他事情，这些事情会让你更接近实现目标并取得好的结果。列出每个步骤中最不重要的，直到最重要的。

**3。奖励自己**——一旦你完成了一项艰巨的任务，为自己创造奖励或奖赏。这样，你会让自己在完成更困难的任务时更加专注和一致，因为在你完成任务后会有奖励。无论是你最喜欢的巧克力棒，还是你告诉自己在完成某些任务之前不要吃的东西，或者是一块昂贵的手表或其他你想买的东西，而是在你做了一些伟大的事情之后留着下次再买。不管是什么，奖励是一个很好的方式来提高你的奉献精神，并继续变得更加一致。

**4。追踪你的进展**——无论你在做什么，都要找到追踪你进展的方法。即使是一小步也很重要！所以不要忽视它，当它存在时告诉自己它什么都不是。只要你全力以赴培养一种习惯，你总会比以前做得更好。通过跟踪你的进步，每次你看到它，你会变得更有动力继续做那个习惯，因为你看到结果，这使你更倾向于跟上它，并使它变得更好。

**5。排除杂念**——远离所有让你变得不稳定的杂念。例如，当你正在做一件对实现你的目标很重要的事情时，你可能会因为电视开着而分心去看一个节目。你没有专注于某项任务，而是开着电视分神，突然失去了继续努力的动力。一次只专注于一件事，避免那些绝对会阻止你坚持不懈的分心事物。
