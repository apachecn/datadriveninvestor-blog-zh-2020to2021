程序员的生活并不容易。人们变得有创造力、沮丧、焦虑，有时甚至臭名昭著，以至于他们在工作(代码)中也包含了自己性格中有趣的一面。在这篇文章中，我将介绍一些有趣的评论，实际上包括我在内的程序员写的。

// At this point, I'd like to take a moment to speak to you about //the Adobe PSD format. PSD is not a good format. PSD is not even a //bad format. Calling it such would be an insult to other bad //formats, such as PCX or JPEG. No, PSD is an abysmal format. Having //worked on this code for several weeks now, my hate for PSD has //grown to a raging fire that burns with the fierce passion of a //million suns.
//
// If there are two different ways of doing something, PSD will do //both, in different places. It will then make up three more ways no //sane human would think of, and do those too. PSD makes //inconsistency an art form. Why, for instance, did it suddenly //decide that *these* particular chunks should be aligned to four //bytes, and that this alignement should *not* be included in
// the size? Other chunks in other places are either unaligned, or //aligned with the alignment included in the size. Here, though, it //is not included. Either one of these three behaviours would be //fine. A sane format would pick one. PSD, of course, uses all three, and more.
//
// Trying to get data out of a PSD file is like trying to find //something in the attic of your eccentric old uncle who died in a //freak freshwater shark attack on his 58th birthday. That last //detail may not be important for the purposes of the simile, but at //this point I am spending a lot of time imagining amusing fates for //the people responsible for this Rube Goldberg of a file format.
//
// Earlier, I tried to get a hold of the latest specs for the PSD //file format. To do this, I had to apply to them for permission to //apply to them to have them consider sending me this sacred tome. //This would have involved faxing them a copy of some document or //other, probably signed in blood. 
//I can only imagine that they make this process so difficult 
//because they are intensely ashamed of having created this 
//abomination. I was naturally not gullible enough to go through //with this procedure, but if I had done so, I would have printed //out every single page of the spec, and set them all on fire. Were //it within my power, I would gather every single copy of those //specs, and launch them on a spaceship directly into the sun.
//
// PSD is not my favourite file format.
